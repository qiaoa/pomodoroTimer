# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is an app that implements the Pomodoro Technique. The technique is a time management method that breaks down work into intervals with breaks in between. Typically, work intervals are 25 minutes long and break intervals are 5 minutes long. The technique encourages users to work with maximum efficiency and focus.
This implementation of the Pomodoro Timer switches between 25 and 5 minutes. A timer displays minutes and seconds, and counts down until 00:00. Start, pause and reset buttons are implemented.
